/** Class to implement the mid-level File access.
  Its main job is to coordinate the reading and the writing of chunks

  The actual I/O is performed through a DiskArray (the global disk
  array for now).

  The class needs to both read and write chunks since the hard drive
  drivers can only talk to a single higher task. Also this solves a
  lot of headakes with making sure that the higher tasks know about
  writes as well as reads.

  The class is designed to do asynchronous reads and writes. Nothing
  blocks while the requests are pending and the higher file scanner
  code gets notified when a job is done.

  Since some tasks might require very few pages, the order of
  finishing the jobs might be different than the order of the
  requests. It is the job of the higher part to reorder the
  accnoledgements if it so desrires (this part acts like the IP
  layer in TCP/IP).

  On Reading, the class creates chunks so it does all the heavy
  lifting in terms of memory allocation and initialization. This is
  why this class should be asynchronous and allow multi-threading.
