/** Driver for individual hard drives.

  The way the class should be used is to put a HDThread on top of
  each available disk and to access exclusively the disk through
  this object. In this way, only on way to access disks exists so
  there is no crazy contention on resources.

  Any scheduling policy with respect to ordering of the requests has
  to be implemented at higher level. The HDThreads are low leve disk
  drivers that just do what told.

  To allow signaling of job termination, the HDThreads use a
  distributed counter and send a signal when the count reaches 0.

  The HDThreads are started and coordinated by the DiskArray
  objects. Preferably, there is only one DiskArray object in the
  systems but the HDThreads do not make that assumption.
